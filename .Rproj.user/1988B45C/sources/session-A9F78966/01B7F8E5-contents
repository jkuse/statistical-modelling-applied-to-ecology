## notes from second class of October 5th 2022

### stardarized or stundentized residuals sometimes are better to see homogeneity of data
### in residuals vs fitted graphs, the smoothed line is expected to be flat, but when it is a bit curved, it may be a quadratic distribution

### acf() - function to deal with autocorrelation - makes a lag
### when funnel shape appears, maybe the first thing to do is search for outliers

----------------normal & poisson------------------------------------------------
## GLM! it has 3 steps
### 1st - need to define the distribution of my random/error variable
### 2nd - need to define the explanatory variables
### 3rd - define link function between response variable and explanatory variables (systematic part of the model)

### systematic part of liner model will predict the most likely/expected value for random variable 
### linear regression is also a GLM!!
### link function links the systematic part of the model with the data scale!!

### GLM uses maximum likelihood, not minimun square
### for poisson dist, L is the value for maximum likelihood

### ways to select models
### hypothesis test or AIC
### comand drop1(): takes off 1 variable and apply a deviation analisys
### use anova, compare the 2 models by a deviation analisys
> anova(M2,M3,test='Chi)

### comand setp(model) -> compares by AIC
### done the selection, you should validate de model
