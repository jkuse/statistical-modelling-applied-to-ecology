## notes from first class of statistical modelling October 5th 2022

### still on eda
### VIF is an index that measures collinearity
### autocorrelation is very common in temporal samples -- how to test for this? ACF?

### there are some models with a linear structure and that are used for non-linear data

### when you have significant values of correlation, you MAY have collinearity, but is not certain, you can generate the model and then do a VIF (variance inflation factor) test to see if collinearity is really happening

## validation
### R squares: a good way to see it is plotting predictions of the model vs observed values
### the most important graph to evaluate premisses: residual vs predicted (must be done AFTER having a model, as a way to validate it) -> must be like a sky full os stars homogenously distributed
### residual vs fitted -> red line should be on zero, horizontaly 
### standarized residuals -> in a scale of -2 to 3
### funnel shape -> indicates heteroscedasticity -> which means, breaking the rule of homogeneity of variances
### qq plot is also a good way to validate a model, but it should be done with the residuals, after having the model
### cook's distance, measures the influence of taking off one variable (usually one that is looking like an outlier) - cook's values > 1 we have a problem: this variable is influencing too much the model
### leverage: is related with cook's distance -> extreme explanatory variables
### autocorrelation should also be tested with an adjusted model

### link function for GLM - put data in a "real scale", because when you choose a distribution different from normal, scale can be changed
### normal - identity
### poisson - log
### binomial - logit
### gamma - reciprocal
