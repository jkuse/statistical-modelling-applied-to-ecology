### notes from third class: bionomial dist
### if there is autocorrelation with data i need GLS
### plot residuals might be interesting 
### binomial dist might be interesting to solve some problems we can't solve: everything that is not zero becomes 1
### Binomial GLM == logistic regression!!!!
### the link function for models with response value == bionomial dist , logit
### p == chance of occurence of something
### q = 1 - p == chance of something else occur
### logit = log of chances = log ratio or log of probabilities in log scale
### chance != probability
### probability = something is like this in 100%
### chance is the probability/percentange of that thing really happen

ex: probability of being infected = 20, so 0.2%
     chance of infected = 0.2/0.8
     
### but we want to know the ratio of chance of males or females being infected
### ratio of chance == odds ratio
    chance of infection males = 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
    chance of infection famales = 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
    odds ratio =
    
when we take off the log of odd ratios, we accept negative values

### when Fisher score is higher than 8, it means that there's no convergence of the model, so it is not valid
## Fisher scoring is an optimization iterative method

### validation of binomial models are a bit differente, it doesn't makes a lot of sense to look a dispersion, residuals vs fitted, etc

### GLM multinomial
### response variable is qualitative, with three or more categories
### multinomial distribution of errors
