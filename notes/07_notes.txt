### notes from autocorrelation class

###autocorrelation can make you find significant relations when there are not
### spatial and temporal
## generalized least squares allow us to use the autocorrelation in models

### examples of situations where we can have autocorrelation
- social behaviour
- temporal series
- spatial or temporal blocks
- animals' movement

### consequences of autocorrelation
- higher rates of type 1 error (the true null hyphotesis is rejected)
- bias in patterns

### temproal autocorrelation
### how population in present time (t) relates to population in passed time: 
autocorrelation in lag 1

### first step is to determine if there is correlation in a temporal serie
### influence of independence of data must be taken off

#### somo sort of strategies to solve autocorrelation in time (Temporal)
- autorregressive model (discrete time) -> needs the generalized least saquares model -> uses a matix of covariance -> funtion gls() -> gives you the correlation values 

### another way to deal with autocorrelation: mobile mea (makes data more soft)
- express the mean of a random variation whithin the last 

### can be jointed with autoregression model
### p and q parameters

## ARIMA -> another way to solve autocorrelation problems


how do I know I'm dealing with temporal problem? 
### estacionaridade -> there is a test to check if there is "estacionaridade"

autocorrelation terms (temporal or spatial) can be used as a random part of the model
(plus random variables)
