### notes from second class October 3rd 2022

#### should I favour adjust or precision? it should be the most parcimonious model

### after EDA, I should set parameters that better fit the data I have, so the model should fit to data, not data to the model
### i should make a lot of models, and from then, i should choose the most parcimonious -> follows all premises, it's validated, and explain enough of my answer variable, but with a minimal effort
## we are always trying to find the simplest models
### less number of parameters
### prefer linear over non linear
### lower number of premises
### simple explanations

## create models in a way that each model represents an hypothesis
## after that, we are going to contrast those models, compare them and rank, and more than one can be used to make predictions (if one mold explains 60% of data, and other explains 30% and atnoher one 10%, we can use the three of them)

## the intercept is a parameter!!! it should be acounted with the other explanatory variables

# GOALS OF THE MODELS!
## explain a phenomena
## predict a phenomena


## in the plot: it is used to validate models after AIC
### residuals vs fitted should be a sky full of homogeneously distributed stars
### normal Q-Q: show how residuals are distributed, and if the line cross all dots, means that it is normally distributed
### scale-location should be a paralel line to zero
### resiudals vs leverage: if a very high or low value falls inside the dotted grey lines, it means that it is putting a lot of weight in the model, and maybe it shpuld be excluded from the model, since it is not an outlier.

### EDA
#### are there NAs?
#### dependencies and independencies
#### what distribution the data are in?
#### correlations

### two approaches for EDA
#### 1. descriptive statistics
#### mean, median, standard deviation
#### 2. graphical analysis
#### we should look for both of them 

## Bolker, p.60 -> Graphical procedures
## from data do viz -> shows you which kind of packages and functions you could use on R to your data

# types of graphs
## Outliers: boxplots, whiskerplots or beeswarm to show you if there are extreme values
### What are the effects of the outliers on the analysis? Anscombe
### extreme values cannot determine my pattern -> if they have too much weight in the model, they should be excluded -> "alavancagem" effect
### when should we exclude an outlier (outliers increase variance and increase the chance of type 2 error/false-negative)

## homogeneity of variances -> Cleveland dotplot
### isolated dots at left or right could mean very different values
### when variances are not homogeneous, it means that we won't be able to fit a simple linear regression

## frequency plot (~ histogram)
### show how data is dispersed, too many zeros, etc

## boxplots are not that good on representing the form of the distribution of data
### we could use than violin plot -> it is more informative about data distribution
### raincloud plot
### we could also use simple histogram!

## leverage occurs and it is a problem when the dot is over 3, and when a dot is with high cook's distance, it will be inside the dotted grey lines in plot
