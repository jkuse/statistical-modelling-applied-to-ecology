### notes from class of October 10th 2022

### ways of correcting autocorrelation:
- "Modelo auto-regressivo" with lag 1
- "Médias móveis" with lag 1 or 
- ARMA: "modelo de auto regressão com média móvel"

### spatial correlation
### how to evaluate spatial correlation?
### variogram, indicates if the distance between residuals, that indicates how similar they are
  components:
  1. sill: in a stable point, we have the premise of stationarity
  2. range: 
  3. nugget: portion of the semi-variance that is not correlated or it is correlated in a smaller dist
  
### in part, problems of autocorrelation can be corrected with the add of another variable

### mixed models

### mixed models can be really complex
ie NAP * beach = Yij = B0j + B1jNAPij + e -> many intercepts, only one slope
   NAP + beach = Yij = B0 + B1jNAPij + e -> only one intercept, many slopes

## fixed factor: influences the mean of y
## random factor: influences the variance of y
## over 4 levels to be treated as random factor, and each factor must have 3 samples at least --> why??? and what kind of information you need for the random variable to be used
## if the main hyphotesis includes a variable, this should be used as explanatory
## random intercept must follow a distribution, it can be normal 


### when using mixed models, we use another type of estimator, thus it changes the protocol of model selection
### usually uses REML or ML (maximum likelihood)

## protocol
1. start with a model with the highest number of fixed values as possible (excluding colinears)
2. get this model and search for the best random structure (with REML).
3. fiding the great structure with AIC, reduce fixed component with the ML method. 
4. simplify the fixed model with drop1
5. run final model of third step with REML.
